# netdata-monitoring

          Simple Monitoring with Netdata

A basic system monitoring dashboard built using Netdata, with automated setup, testing, and cleanup scripts.
Demonstrates hands-on experience with Linux monitoring, observability, and DevOps automation.

          🚀 What This Project Does

Installs and configures Netdata on a Linux system

Monitors core system health metrics in real time

Exposes a web-based monitoring dashboard

Implements customization and alerting

Automates setup, testing, and teardown with shell scripts

          📊 Metrics Monitored

CPU usage

Memory usage

Disk I/O

System health and performance trends (real time)

          🛠️ Automation Scripts
Script        Purpose
setup.sh        Installs and configures Netdata
test_dashboard.sh        Generates system load to validate charts & alerts
cleanup.sh        Removes Netdata and cleans the system

This reflects real DevOps workflows, not manual-only setup.

          🔔 Alerts & Customization

Configured alerts (e.g., CPU usage > 80%)

Customized dashboard elements (charts, views, or metrics)

Demonstrates understanding of proactive monitoring, not just visualization.

          ⚙️ Installation (One-Line Setup)
curl https://get.netdata.cloud/kickstart.sh | sh

Dashboard is accessible via browser after installation.
